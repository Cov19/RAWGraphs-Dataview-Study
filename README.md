**Study releated to SARS-COV Data in relation to Shigellosis**
>>> Repo under construction

This is for a study related to SARS-associated Coronavirus in relation to Shigellosis, not Covid-19. However, it should still be quite insightful. The original data source is [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nndss-table-1ff-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-associated-coronavirus-disease-to-shigel), the data is labeled for public access and use. All origin data rights (as always) are to its perspective owners. This is just intented as a visualization case study in which we are the perspective visualization authors. All rights of the origin data is to the CDC and the data used for the visualization is part of the [data.gov](data.gov) catalog.
